# CUDA Boids

## ‚òëÔ∏è TODO:

1. Take a screenshot of the boids and use a gif tool like licecap to record an animations of the boids with a fixed camera. Put this at the top of your README.md. Take a look at How to make an attractive GitHub repo.
2. Add your performance analysis. Graphs to include:
    - Framerate change with increasing # of boids for naive, scattered uniform grid, and coherent uniform grid (with and without visualization)
    - Framerate change with increasing block size

## üìÉ Analysis

- For each implementation, how does changing the number of boids affect performance? Why do you think this is?
- For each implementation, how does changing the block count and block size affect performance? Why do you think this is?
- For the coherent uniform grid: did you experience any performance improvements with the more coherent uniform grid? Was this the outcome you expected? Why or why not?
- Did changing cell width and checking 27 vs 8 neighboring cells affect performance? Why or why not? Be careful: it is insufficient (and possibly incorrect) to say that 27-cell is slower simply because there are more cells to check!
