# CUDA Boids

**This project is a CUDA implementation of a flocking simulation based on the Reynolds Boids algorithm, previewing two levels of optimization: using a uniform grid, and using a uniform grid with semi-coherent memory access. This was done as part of UPenn CIS 5650 (GPU Programming & Architecture).**

## ‚òëÔ∏è Performance Results

#### Method Explanation

For all comparisons graphed below, the FPS was recorded over 12 seconds from program start time, then averaged.

### Boids vs FPS <span style="color: aqua;">*with visualization*</span>

![graph1](boids_vs_fps_with_vis.png)

Note: Block Size was 128. 

### Boids vs FPS <span style="color: crimson">*without visualization*</span>

![graph2](boids_vs_fps_without_vis.png)

Note: Block Size was 128. 

### Block Size vs FPS

![graph3](block_size_vs_fps.png)

Note: Used coherent grid with 100,000 boids, visualization on. 

## üìÉ Performance Analysis

#### Q. For each implementation, how does changing the number of boids affect performance? Why do you think this is?
#### Q. For each implementation, how does changing the block count and block size affect performance? Why do you think this is?
#### Q. For the coherent uniform grid: did you experience any performance improvements with the more coherent uniform grid? Was this the outcome you expected? Why or why not?
#### Q. Did changing cell width and checking 27 vs 8 neighboring cells affect performance? Why or why not? Be careful: it is insufficient (and possibly incorrect) to say that 27-cell is slower simply because there are more cells to check!
